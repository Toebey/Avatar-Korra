		<h2>About Korra</h2>
		<p>Korra is a water bender from the Southern water tribe who is chosen to be the Avatar. Her main duty as avatar is to restore peace and harmony to the world. She is required to master all four elements, which is something only the avatar can do and although it doing so won't be easy, she can always count on her friends and air bending master for help when needed.</p>
